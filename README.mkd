I'm not the original author.  It appears to be abandoned by him and so I'm just bumping the supported firefox version number (note: firefox doesn't automatically disable extensions so this no longer applies).  I'm only going to fix bugs related to new versions of firefox (maybe).  May add minor enhancements but a key feature of this add on is that it's very lean and I plan to keep it that way.
